AI Risk Evaluator is a web app where users can input project descriptions, updates, or planning notes in free text. The app uses AI to analyze the content and returns identified project risks—such as issues related to scope, timeline, dependencies, or team—along with the severity level (low, medium, or high) and suggested mitigation strategies.
